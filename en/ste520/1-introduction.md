## Safety and standards

3D printer Stereotech meets the requirements for this type of equipment on the territory of the Eurasian Economic Union (Declaration of Conformity of the EEU No.RU ДRU.АБ93.В.10000).

## Principle of operation

### Product strength

Thanks to the orientation property of polymers, 5Dtech increases the bending and compressive strength. Your parts will be:
* Up to х4 times stronger than 3D

* 32% stronger than casting

### Reinforced structure

Owing to the volumetric, not layered, material deposition, 5Dtech technology reinforces the product structure. Use this advantage when printing with continuous fiber and create exceptionally strong quasi-isotropic products.

### Printing without supports

Thanks to the multi-axis kinematics, 5Dtech allows to avoid or significantly reduce the use of supports under the overhanging elements of the product, which increases production rates, reduces post-processing time and ensures material savings of up to 70%.

### High speed

Due to the optimization of travel paths (longer filling areas where the printer has time to reach the set speed), 5D printing speed is up to 2 times higher than in 3D printing.

### Printing on any surface

In contrast to classic 3D printing, 5Dtech can print on any surface. Use special tooling for mass production of products or a pre-fabricated blank that will become part of the future product — now you can create composite parts with metal reinforcement.

### Ease of use

5Dtech algorithms ensure automatic preparation of parts for multi-axis printing, in contrast to industrial solutions that require complex manual CAM preparation of the control program. Printing will be as easy as on a regular 3D printer.

### No limitations

Use your regular programs for CAD modelling. The STE Slicer software is compatible with STL, a common format for 3D printing, in contrast to industrial solutions that only work with proprietary CAD model formats in preparation for multi-axis printing.

### Wide range of capabilities

5D printer and STE Slicer software allow to work with several printing modes and combine them. Use Classic printing / Spiral printing / Trend line printing / Surface printing modes to perform any jobs.
